Running the model is as easy as executing ```python main.py```

However, I recommend "cleaning" the datasets first. To do so use ```python baginfo.py```, it may take a while! Also remember to set all the paths to your file locations!

By default, the script uses Udacity's datasets:

- Dataset 3 for training (3 hours of driving)
- Dataset 2 for validation (12 minutes of driving)
- Dataset 1 for testing (some seconds)
