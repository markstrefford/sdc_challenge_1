# Turing Tuning #

## Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree - Challenge 1

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is intended to be used by the Turing Tuning team members to submit their code to solve the Challenge 1 of the Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree offered by Udacity.

Each team member will have its own directory that can be used to keep track of his code changes and versions. At the same time, there will be a common directory for the final code of the challenge, this code should be always compileable without errors and it is the one that will be used to train on the datasets provided by Udacity and that will be delivered as solution to the challenge. Ideally, this code will be created from the contributions and proposals of all the team members.

### Environment ###

To have a common environment to work with, we have proposed to use the following environment configuration: Last versions of Tensorflow + Keras as Deep Learning frameworks, running on top of Python 2.7. 

There is freedom to use any OS as long as the code is not OS/architecture dependent (which shouldn't be).

### Contribution guidelines ###

Each team member will always commit/push to its own directory, but they and are free to copy, modify and improve code from other team members as long this new code is uploaded to the respective member directory.

Results of the code and new discoveries will be communicated through the Slack channel and the best performing code will be put in the common directory.

### Who do I talk to? ###

Our main channel of communication is the Slack channel: https://nd013.slack.com/messages/team_drive/
